# Verilog Projects for DE10-Lite Board
This repository contains various Verilog projects created for the DE10-Lite Board. Each project is contained in a separate folder with its own set of Verilog source files and testbench files.

# Projects
The following projects are included in this repository:

4-Bit-Full-Adder-main: A 4-bit full adder circuit that adds two 4-bit numbers and generates a 5-bit sum.

8-Bit-Array-Multiplier-main: An 8-bit array multiplier circuit that multiplies two 8-bit numbers and generates a 16-bit product.

8-Bit-Full-Adder-main: An 8-bit full adder circuit that adds two 8-bit numbers and generates a 9-bit sum.

Countdown-Clock-main: A countdown clock that displays the time remaining on a 7-segment display.

Full-Adder-main: A full adder circuit that adds two bits and generates a sum and a carry.

# Usage
Each project can be synthesized and tested on the DE10-Lite Board using the Quartus Prime software. To synthesize a project, open the project folder in Quartus Prime and run the synthesis and compilation process. Then, program the DE10-Lite Board with the generated .sof file.

To test a project, open the testbench file in Quartus Prime and simulate the circuit using ModelSim. The testbench file contains test vectors that can be modified to test different inputs and outputs.
